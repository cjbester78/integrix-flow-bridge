# TODO: Test Data Structures Save Functionality with Backend API

## Problem Analysis
Based on the previous conversation summary, I have completed migrating the data structures from in-memory storage to backend API integration. The `useDataStructures` hook now uses the `structureService` for all operations, but I need to test that the save functionality actually works with the backend API.

## Current Status
- ✅ Updated `useDataStructures.ts` to use backend API calls instead of in-memory data
- ✅ Added proper error handling and toast notifications
- ✅ Implemented fallback to sample data when backend API is not available
- ❓ Need to test the actual save functionality to confirm it works end-to-end

## Plan

### Task 1: Verify Backend API Endpoint Status
- [ ] Check if the backend structures API endpoint (`/api/structures`) is implemented
- [ ] Test the POST endpoint for creating structures
- [ ] Document any missing backend implementations

### Task 2: Test Frontend Data Structure Save
- [ ] Start the backend server
- [ ] Start the frontend development server
- [ ] Navigate to Data Structures page
- [ ] Try to save a new data structure
- [ ] Verify the API call is made correctly
- [ ] Check if the structure appears in the list after saving

### Task 3: Handle Backend API Gaps
- [ ] If backend API returns 403/404, confirm fallback logic works
- [ ] Ensure user gets appropriate feedback when backend is unavailable
- [ ] Document which backend endpoints need implementation

### Task 4: Final Verification
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Verify error handling works properly
- [ ] Confirm toast notifications appear correctly
- [ ] Test loading states

## Expected Outcomes
- Data structures can be saved to the backend when API is available
- Graceful fallback to sample data when backend API is not implemented
- User receives clear feedback about save success/failure
- All operations work seamlessly from the frontend perspective

## Notes
- The frontend is now properly configured to use backend APIs
- The `structureService` has comprehensive API methods
- Backend may not have the structures controller fully implemented yet
