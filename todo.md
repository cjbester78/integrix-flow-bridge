# TODO: Complete Sender and Receiver Adapters Implementation

## Problem Analysis
User wants to complete the implementation of sender and receiver adapters with their respective business logic. Based on the codebase analysis, there are adapter configurations and some implementations, but the core logic needs to be completed.

## Current Status
- Adapter configuration classes exist for various types (HTTP, File, FTP, JDBC, etc.)
- Some adapter implementations exist but may need completion
- Factory pattern is in place for adapter creation
- Need to implement the actual business logic for sending/receiving data

## Plan

### Task 1: Analyze Current Adapter Implementation Status ‚úÖ
- [x] Review existing adapter implementations in adapters/src/main/java/com/integrationlab/adapters/impl/
- [x] Check which adapters have complete implementations vs placeholders
- [x] Identify missing core adapter logic
- [x] Analyze frontend adapter configurations vs backend expectations

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:**
üö® **Inconsistent Implementation of Middleware Conventions:**

**‚úÖ CORRECT (HTTP Adapters):**
- Frontend HttpSenderAdapterConfig: "where 3rd party sends requests" (inbound) ‚úÖ
- Frontend HttpReceiverAdapterConfig: "3rd party API endpoint" (outbound) ‚úÖ  
- Backend HttpSenderAdapter: Creates endpoints for receiving (inbound) ‚úÖ
- Backend HttpReceiverAdapter: Makes requests to external systems (outbound) ‚úÖ

**‚ùå WRONG (JDBC Adapters):**
- Frontend JdbcSenderAdapterConfig: Uses "Target" + "INSERT INTO" (outbound) ‚ùå Should be inbound
- Frontend JdbcReceiverAdapterConfig: Uses "Source" + "SELECT" (inbound) ‚ùå Should be outbound
- Backend JdbcSenderAdapter: Does INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (outbound) ‚ùå Should be inbound  
- Backend JdbcReceiverAdapter: Does SELECT with polling (inbound) ‚úÖ Correct

**Existing Implementations:**
- ‚úÖ HttpSenderAdapter: Complete (inbound HTTP endpoint)
- ‚úÖ HttpReceiverAdapter: Complete (outbound HTTP requests)
- ‚ùå JdbcSenderAdapter: Wrong direction (does INSERT - should do SELECT/polling)
- ‚úÖ JdbcReceiverAdapter: Correct (inbound SELECT/polling)

**Missing Implementations:** 18 adapter types need to be created

### Task 2: Complete Core Adapter Interface and Base Classes
- [ ] Ensure BaseAdapter interface is properly defined
- [ ] Complete SenderAdapter and ReceiverAdapter interfaces
- [ ] Implement common adapter functionality in base classes
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging patterns

### Task 3: Complete Sender Adapter Implementations
- [ ] FileSenderAdapter - File system monitoring and reading
- [ ] HttpSenderAdapter - HTTP endpoint receiving/listening
- [ ] FtpSenderAdapter - FTP server monitoring
- [ ] JdbcSenderAdapter - Database polling and change detection
- [ ] MailSenderAdapter - Email inbox monitoring
- [ ] JmsSenderAdapter - JMS queue/topic listening
- [ ] SoapSenderAdapter - SOAP endpoint receiving
- [ ] RestSenderAdapter - REST endpoint receiving
- [ ] Other sender adapters as needed

### Task 4: Complete Receiver Adapter Implementations
- [ ] FileReceiverAdapter - File creation and writing
- [ ] HttpReceiverAdapter - HTTP requests to external systems
- [ ] FtpReceiverAdapter - FTP file uploads
- [ ] JdbcReceiverAdapter - Database inserts/updates
- [ ] MailReceiverAdapter - Email sending
- [ ] JmsReceiverAdapter - JMS message publishing
- [ ] SoapReceiverAdapter - SOAP service calls
- [ ] RestReceiverAdapter - REST API calls
- [ ] Other receiver adapters as needed

### Task 5: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Update AdapterFactory to properly instantiate all adapters
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement connection pooling where appropriate
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Test adapter functionality end-to-end

## Expected Outcomes
- All adapter types have complete sender and receiver implementations
- Adapters can successfully send and receive data according to their configurations
- Proper error handling, logging, and monitoring in place
- Factory pattern properly creates and manages adapter instances
- End-to-end functionality working for integration flows

## Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Follow the reversed middleware terminology:
  - **Sender Adapter** = Receives data FROM external systems (inbound)
  - **Receiver Adapter** = Sends data TO external systems (outbound)
- Focus on core business logic implementation
- Ensure proper connection management and resource cleanup
- Add appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
