# Comprehensive Code Review Plan - Integrix Flow Bridge

## Review Scope
Complete analysis of all Java and React/TypeScript code for:
- Code completeness and functionality
- Best practices adherence
- Object-oriented design principles
- Documentation standards
- Error handling
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization

## Java Backend Review Structure

### 1. Module Analysis Order
- [ ] shared-lib - Common DTOs, enums, utilities
- [ ] data-access - JPA entities & repositories  
- [ ] adapters - Adapter implementations
- [ ] engine - Flow execution engine
- [ ] monitoring - Logging & monitoring
- [ ] webserver - External web service clients
- [ ] webclient - Inbound message processing
- [ ] soap-bindings - SOAP service bindings
- [ ] backend - Main Spring Boot application

### 2. Java Review Checklist per Class
- [ ] Proper package structure
- [ ] Class responsibilities (Single Responsibility Principle)
- [ ] Javadoc documentation
- [ ] Method documentation
- [ ] Exception handling
- [ ] Null safety
- [ ] Thread safety where needed
- [ ] Proper use of annotations
- [ ] Lombok usage optimization
- [ ] Design patterns implementation
- [ ] Unit test coverage
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance considerations

### 3. OOP Principles Check
- [ ] Encapsulation - proper access modifiers
- [ ] Inheritance - appropriate use of abstract classes/interfaces
- [ ] Polymorphism - proper method overriding
- [ ] Abstraction - clean interfaces
- [ ] SOLID principles adherence

## React/TypeScript Frontend Review Structure

### 1. Component Analysis Order
- [ ] types/ - TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] services/ - API service layers
- [ ] hooks/ - Custom React hooks
- [ ] components/ui/ - Base UI components
- [ ] components/adapter/ - Adapter-specific components
- [ ] components/flow/ - Flow management components
- [ ] components/admin/ - Admin panel components
- [ ] pages/ - Route components
- [ ] utils/ - Utility functions

### 2. React/TypeScript Review Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Proper type definitions (no 'any' types)
- [ ] Component documentation
- [ ] Props validation
- [ ] Error boundaries
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Accessibility (ARIA labels)
- [ ] Performance (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] Custom hooks best practices
- [ ] State management patterns
- [ ] API error handling

### 3. React Best Practices
- [ ] Functional components consistency
- [ ] Proper hook usage and dependencies
- [ ] Component composition over inheritance
- [ ] Prop drilling avoidance
- [ ] Side effect management
- [ ] Code splitting where appropriate

## Review Process
1. Start with shared/common modules
2. Review core business logic
3. Check integration points
4. Analyze UI components
5. Document findings and recommendations
6. Create improvement tasks

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive findings report
- List of critical issues
- Best practice violations
- Improvement recommendations
- Refactoring suggestions
- Security vulnerability report
